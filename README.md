# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-RNN-using-Python
This project utilizes RNN in making price predictions over a period of time, based on the data you have.
Language used here is python.

How to go about it:
Just Insert your file path of the data you have (csv file) and indicate the column you want to do the prediction on.

NotE:
You might get an error like  "AssertionError: Duplicate registrations for type optimizer".
This is currently a problem I'm facing on my machine but might work on others. Just try it
